# Premium News and Subscription API

This project is a training playground to practice **Laravel** for backend and API development.

The goals are:

- Practice designing a small REST API in Laravel
- Train database modeling and Eloquent relationships
- Practice factories, seeders, and migrations
- Get comfortable with form requests, validation, and error handling
- Use a clean structure (routes, controllers, services) similar to a real job project


The project will evolve step by step as I add features and refactor code.
